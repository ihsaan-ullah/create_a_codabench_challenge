# Overview

FAIR-UNIVERSE toy competition is designed for classification purpose. In large hydron colliders, when particles collide, new particles are formed with release of energy. Each collision produces several particles with different sizes and energy. It is important to recognize and classify these particles into categories/classes.

As these experiments are expensive, therefore researchers have created simulators which simulates the real environment and genetare data. 

### Task
The task of the this competition is classificaiton of signal vs background where signal is an event (creation of a particle of interest) and background consists of all other events.


### Installation
In order to run this bundle locally, you need to install the following packages:
- pyyaml
- numpy
- pandas

It is recommended to use virtual environments e.g. conda env
